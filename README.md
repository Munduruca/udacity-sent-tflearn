# udacity-sent-tflearn
this is a simple tflearn approach for sentiment analysis using imdb database (pickle)
I included a compressed version of the saved model (rico_model.zip) and the imdb database.

#todo:
we still need to fix 2 points which are 
1. load the ".tflearn" model
2. predict sentiment using a random sentece
